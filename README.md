# Fire Classifier
A Fire Classifier the GT Aerial Robotics team's entry into the MBZIRC (Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robitics Competition) in 2019. In Progress Report.pdf, my learnings can be found and I have supplied all the deliverables mentioned in that document in this repo.

## Improvements and Next Steps
Next Steps:

- Experiment with the ratio of positive and negative images to see which ratio
yields the best results for training a classifier
- Try training the classifier with larger images
- Look into classification by detection patterns in motion
- Look into adding a thermal thresholding component to which ever algorithm used
- Look into CUDA software as a way to spend up the trainer process
